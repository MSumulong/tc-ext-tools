		By default, I have setup kdm (KDE Display Manager) to login user=tc automatically
		If you want to change kdm settings you have to run "systemsettings" as root.
		Kdm settings is located at the bottom of the advanced tab.
		You can install kdm themes from web after running systemsettings as root.
		The kdm themes downloaded from web is installed into /usr/local/share/apps/kdm/themes
		So you need to add appropriate directory to your backup list for persistency.

		If you wish to reboot or poweroff your pc with KDM "Restart" & "Shutdown" then you have to backup your data manually (filetool.sh backup) before exiting.
		Use the Exit desktop widget If you want to exit with backup.

		Optional KDE packages to extend KDE desktop: network-manager-kde, kdeartwork, kdemultimedia, kdepim, kdenetwork, kdeplasma-addons, kdegames, kdetoys, kdeedu, kdeaccessibility ...
		KDE Applications: k3b, kdesvn, ktorrent, koffice, amarok ...
		Other extensions that KDE can benefit from: samba3, avahi, gstreamer plugins, acpid, wicd, cpufreqd ...
		
		ALSA is recommended for sound.

		This extension is PPI compatible."
