COMMENTS="LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office suites, and available
		on a variety of platforms. The goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF
		support and without any copyright assignment requirements. The name is a hybrid word with the first
		part Libre, which means free (as in freedom) in both Spanish and French and the English word Office.
		As free software, users are free to download, modify, use and distribute LibreOffice

		Optional extensions:
			ALSA or OSS, gst-plugins-*, gst-ffmpeg, unixODBC, ImageMagick, liberation-fonts-ttf,
			sil-gentium-ttf, sil-gentium-basic-ttf, msttcorefonts (available at forums/scripting),
			openclipart-svg, cups, hunspell-en-us (or any other hunspell dictionary) ...

		OpenOffice.org extensions are also recommended.(dictionaries,templates etc.)

		You can install OpenOffice.org extensions from http://extensions.services.openoffice.org
		Download any extension and Tools->Extension Manager->Add and select the extension (.oxt) file to install

		LibreOffice installs OpenOffice3 extensions into ~/.openoffice.org

		This extension conflicts with openoffice3.

		This extension is PPI compatible."
