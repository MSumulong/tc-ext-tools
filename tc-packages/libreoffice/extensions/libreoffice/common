COMMENTS="LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office suites, and available
		on a variety of platforms. The goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF
		support and without any copyright assignment requirements. The name is a hybrid word with the first
		part Libre, which means free (as in freedom) in both Spanish and French and the English word Office.
		As free software, users are free to download, modify, use and distribute LibreOffice

		Optional dependencies:
			ALSA or OSS, gst-plugins-*, gst-ffmpeg, unixODBC, ImageMagick, liberation-fonts-ttf,
			sil-gentium-ttf, sil-gentium-basic-ttf, msttcorefonts (available at forums/scripting),
			openclipart-svg, cups, hunspell-en-us (or any other hunspell dictionary) ...

		You can install LibreOffice extensions (dictionaries,templates etc.) from
		http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List
		Download an extension, then inside the program go to
		Tools->Extension Manager->Add and select the extension (.oxt) file to install.
		LibreOffice installs the user extensions into ~/.libreoffice directory.

		Important Note: This version of libreoffice is compiled with java support.
		So you need to add libreoffice.tcz to your onboot.lst and reboot your computer.
		If you have sun-jre.tcz in your onboot.lst then you don't need to reboot.
		Setting PATH and JAVA_HOME in a terminal does not help.

		If you want to use libreoffice ondemand, load sun-jre once and
		add etc/profile.d/sun-jre.sh to your backup list (/opt/.filetool.lst), and then reboot.
		If you have mounted sun-jre don't forget to copy sun-jre.sh to root file system.
		(sudo cp /etc/profile.d/sun-jre.sh /etc/profile.d/)

		This extension is PPI compatible."
