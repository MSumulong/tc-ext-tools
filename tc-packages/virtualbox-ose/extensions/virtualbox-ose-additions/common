DESCRIPTION="A Powerful x86 virtualization solution, guest additions."
COMMENTS="Xorg should be able to run in confless mode but if you wish
		you can configure X settings to load proper drivers for virtualbox.
		Basic installation steps:
		1-) Exit to prompt
		2-) Copy /usr/local/share/virtualbox-ose-additions/xorg.conf.sample to 
			/etc/X11/xorg.conf and edit for your needs (i.e keyboard layout)
		3-) Test it by running startx
		4-) Add etc/X11/xorg.conf to your backup list (/opt/.filetool.lst)

		This extension depends on Xorg.
		This extension is PPI compatible."
