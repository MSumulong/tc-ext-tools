COMMENTS="For first time setup is necessary to disable wbar,
		or at least move it from the bottom.
		so boot with "noicons" cause the wbar is overlapping the 
		"next" button in the wm wizard.
		In order to have this package localized u have 3 options:
		1- put this extension in the copy2fs.lst
	        2- create copy2fs.flg
		3- in the e17 configuration, advanced, directory,
		   messages add /usr/local/share/locale.
		Same story for "e" to see the extra modules, but the dir in 
		configuration should be the one for the modules.
		optional dep: ephysics for the physics module.
		In case u use the e17 shutdown/restart instead of the exit 
		tc gui the backup will be performed dipending on the global
		BACKUP variable"
