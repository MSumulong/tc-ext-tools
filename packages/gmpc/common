                About
                -----
                GMPC is a GTK2 frontend for Music Player Daemon.

                It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, while
                providing full access to all of MPD's features. Users are
                presented with several different methods to browse through
                their music.

                It can be extended by plugins, of which many are available.

                GMPC is the oldest maintained Graphical client for MPD. The
                project was started in 2003 and been under constant development
                ever since."
