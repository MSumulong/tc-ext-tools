# This file contains the options used in the Xulrunner build. You may
# need to specify additional options for your specific build needs.
# Use the information provided by running './configure --help' to
# help you determine if you need to add any additional options.
# Some additional options can be added by uncommenting the examples
# in this file or adding options by inserting a line containing
# 'ac_add_options --some-option-you-need'.  Be aware that some accepted
# options, such as '--with-system-bz2', do not affect the build.

# specify that we want to build xulrunner
ac_add_options --enable-application=xulrunner

# to a directory inside the source tree by removing '../' from the
# line below.
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/xulrunner-build

# These options are used so that the Xulrunner binaries are linked to
# the system-installed copies of the specified libraries instead of
# the source tree code which may not be the most recent versions.
# With the exception of libsqlite3, the libraries are statically linked.

# (Options to use system installed libraries)
# Using the shipped version of libsqlite3 has been reported to cause
# problems with other applications which were using sqlite3.
# Only comment this line if you know exactly what you are doing!

# Comment this if you have not installed lcms.
ac_add_options --enable-system-lcms

# Comment this if you did not build libjpeg before GTK+-2.
ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg

# These two options enable support for building Xulrunner with
# system-installed versions of the Network Security Services (NSS)
# and Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) libraries. Comment them if
# you wish to use the included copies (not recommended).
ac_add_options --with-system-nspr

# Comment this if you have wireless-tools installed and wish to use the new
# Necko WiFi scanning.
#ac_add_options --disable-necko-wifi

# This option is added so that the Mozilla Installer program is not

# installation of Xulrunner.
ac_add_options --disable-installer

# If you enable javaxpcom, you must have a java compiler installed.
ac_add_options --disable-javaxpcom

# This option is added so that test libraries and programs are not

# This option is used so that the debugging symbols are removed from

# this option if you may have a need to retain the debugging symbols
# in the installed binaries (the resulting binaries will be about 7MB
# bigger).

# display using the X-Window Xinerama libraries.
