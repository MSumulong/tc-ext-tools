COMMENTS="Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of 
		the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use 
		whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' 
		hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain 
		in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using 
		particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to move to otherwise 
		inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not 
		hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.

		You need OSS or ALSA for sound.
		You need GPU acceleration for smooth playing experience.

		This extension requires Xorg.
