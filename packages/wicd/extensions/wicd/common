COMMENTS="To start wicd daemon add to your boot script (/opt/bootlocal.sh):
		  /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
		  /usr/local/etc/init.d/wicd start

		For persistency add to your backup list (/opt/.filetool.lst):

		  var/lib/wicd/configurations

		It is recommended to add wicd.tcz to your onboot list and reboot for the first time.

		Optional dependency:
		  notify-python-2.7 for desktop notifications (a notification daemon needs to be running)

		make sure you have the correct firmware loaded. See firmware, firmware-iwlwifi and others."
