COMMENTS="This just an engine so you need a theme to use it.
		1-) Download one that uses unico gtk3 engine from http://gnome-look.org/
		2-) Extract the theme folder to /usr/local/share/themes
		3-) Edit ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini:
		   gtk-theme-name = <theme> (actually name of the folder in /usr/local/share/themes)

		You can use unico engine together with gtk-engine-murrine and a theme that supports both
		to have a unique look with gtk2 and gtk3 applications."
