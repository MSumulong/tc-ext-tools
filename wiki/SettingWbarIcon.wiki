#summary How to set icon for your extension.

== Setting application icons in tc-ext-tools ==

To set a wbar icon for any extension set ICON in extension's common file (create one if it does not exist)

{{{
ICON=/full/path/to/icon
}}}

If the desktop file name is not same as the extension and/or it is not located in share/applications then you must set DESKTOP also

DESKTOP=/full/path/to/desktop
}}}
