#summary This wiki page will give you the basics about tc-ext-tools.

= Introduction =

TC-EXT-TOOLS is an extension build system developed to run under Tiny Core Linux. The main aim aim of the project is to provide a high-level, easy extension maintenance system for TCL package (tcz) maintainers. One of the best designs of tc-ext-tools is the idea of hosting the package build files in an svn repository. Thus all the information to build a package is publicly available to everyone.

= Design Concepts =

 * Divide and conquer.
 * Ease of use.
 * Minimize initial packaging time.
 * Each package has a source, and source is a tarball or vcs repository (support for git and svn currently).
 * Extensions are created from packages.
 * All the information to build the packages is hosted under an svn repository and it is available to everyone publicly.

= Installation =

Download and extract the tarball or check out from svn repository and follow instructions in INSTALL file.

{{{
svn checkout http://tc-ext-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

= Usage =

*Adding a new package*
  * First boost the package with boostit
{{{
mkdir package
cd package
boostit package version "extension1 extension2 ..."
}}}
_Hint: version can be a number, "svn" or "git"._

  * Then edit the files generated under package root directory using your favorite file manager and text editor.
{{{
mytexteditor {common, build etc.}
}}}
  * Most important ones you need to specify in the common file are SOURCE,SOURCE_URL, TOP_SRC, BUILD_DEPENDS, and in the build file configure, compile, install functions. Rules function is placed in the build file to give complete control to the user for defining the build rules.
_Hint: SOURCE_URL can be the direct link for a tarball or the url of an svn or git repository._

_Hint: Make sure you entered SOURCE and TOP_SRC correctly._
  * Then you can execute buildit in the package root directory to build the package with the rules defined in the build file.
{{{

  * When creating a package for the first time you better advance step by step.
