#summary Facts about extensions.

= Extensions in tc-ext-tools =

In package root file system extensions are located under the extensions directory. Any extension that has the *install* file will be treated as an extension to be created.

== Package files list ==

The list of all files in the package. It is located under the package root extensions directory. Use this list to prepare extension install files.

{{{
extensions/list
}}}

== Extension files to edit ==
{{{
common
dep
install
tce.installed
}}}

=== common ===

By default extensions are named after the directory names in package root extensions folder. If you wish to change the name then set *NAME* in the *extension's common* file

{{{
NAME=EXTENSION_NAME
}}}

Also you can override extension info variables in extension's common file such as DESCRIPTION, COMMENTS etc.

tc-ext-tools automatically append strings to specific extensions' description such as -dev, -locale, -doc however you can always override these varibles using extension's common file

=== dep ===

This is the dependecies list of the extension. Remember you can comment out any line with the # operator.

=== install ===

This is one of the best features of tc-ext-tools. Just like in a debian package you can set this file similarly to install files which will go into your extension.

To exclude files or directories use x- operator
{{{
path/to/include
x-path/to/exclude
}}}

_See the package files list under the extensions directory_

=== tce.installed ===

This is the script that is executed when the extension is loaded. Don't worry about permissions they will be set by tc-ext-tools.
