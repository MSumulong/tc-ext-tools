## Setting application icons in tc-ext-tools ##

To set a wbar icon for any extension set **ICON** in **extension's common** file (create one if it does not exist)

```
ICON=/full/path/to/icon
```

If the desktop file name is not same as the extension and/or it is not located in **share/applications** then you must set **DESKTOP** also

```
DESKTOP=/full/path/to/desktop
```
